Hypothesis 1: 

•	Null Hypothesis 
Cohesion metric has a strong co relation to the number of quality issues

•	Alternate Hypothesis
Cohesion metric doesn’t have a strong co relation to the number of quality issues

Hypothesis 2: 

•	Null Hypothesis 
Coupling metric has a strong co relation to the number of quality issues

•	Alternate Hypothesis
Coupling metric doesn’t have a strong co relation to the number of quality issues

Hypothesis 3: 

•	Null Hypothesis 
Number of quality issues has a strong co relation to the security of the project

•	Alternate Hypothesis
Number of quality issues doesn’t have a strong co relation to the security of the project

Hypothesis 4: 

•	Null Hypothesis 
Cyclomatic complexity has a strong co relation to the number of quality issues

•	Alternate Hypothesis
Cyclomatic complexity doesn’t have a strong co relation to the number of quality issues

Hypothesis 5: 

•	Null Hypothesis 
Cyclomatic complexity has a strong co relation to the maintainability of the project

•	Alternate Hypothesis
Cyclomatic complexity doesn’t have a strong co relation to the maintainability of the project
